# Decision_Tree

For classification and prediction purposes, decision trees are a common and effective tool.

Decision trees can be continuous/regressive or categorical. The results of new data are based on a single, discrete variable in a categorical decision tree. Continuous decision tree results, on the other hand, are based on previous decision node results. Combining the output of a number of decision trees can improve the accuracy of decision trees.
